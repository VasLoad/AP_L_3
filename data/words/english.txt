Yesterday in our Telegram channel the usual holy war erupted again about how to live correctly in 2025.
One guy keeps insisting that if you're still writing plain Spring Boot without GraalVM Native Image, you're basically a caveman: 40-second build times, 600 MB RAM on startup, just go hide in shame. Second dude fires back: “Bro, I've got a Java 21 monolith with virtual threads doing 10k RPS on a single core, I don't care about your native binary, if it flies in prod I'm not touching it.”
Then the third one barges in: “Guys, you're both dinosaurs. Real chads are writing Go + HTMX now: backend is a 15 MB static binary, frontend is basically no JS, everything server-rendered, zero SPA circus.”
The fourth guy silently drops a screenshot of his pet project: NestJS + Turborepo + tRPC + Next.js 15 with React Server Components + Prisma + Drizzle running as edge functions on Vercel, and just writes “yeah, sure, sure.”
In the end everyone agreed that the only thing that actually matters is green tests, no 3 a.m. alerts, and salary hitting the account on time. Everything else is just flame wars till dawn and “well in MY pet project it's different.” Classic.
Then our team lead shows up with shining eyes: “Lads, starting Monday we're moving the entire backend to Rust + Axum + Tokio + SQLx.” Everyone: “Cool, and what about the current 800 microservices in Node.js and TypeScript?” Him: “We'll gradually refactor… give or take five years.” Chat goes silent for 30 seconds, then a senior drops the meme of a burning house with caption “Subtle plan.”
Product manager storms in: “Guys, we urgently need an AI feature: user uploads a passport photo and we instantly offer them a loan.” Everyone: “Nice, where's the model?” — “I asked Claude yesterday, he gave me a prompt, here you go, use it.” Prompt is 1200 tokens long and starts with “You are an experienced bank clerk with 20 years of expertise and a great sense of humor.”
Next morning the DevOps guy is quietly crying: Kubernetes cluster went down because someone put memory: 999999Gi in values.yaml “just in case.” Helm upgrade succeeded, nodes obviously didn't. While we were fixing it, Kafka backlogs grew to 42 million messages, and product extended the deadline to “whenever you fix it.”
At least on Friday we have a corporate party: pizza, board games, and a talk titled “How to switch to Kotlin Multiplatform and write one codebase for Android, iOS, backend and desktop without going insane.” Speaker is the same guy who promised a year ago that we'd all be writing both backend and frontend in Flutter.
Woke up at 7:12 to an alert: “P90 latency on /checkout jumped to 840 ms, URGENT!!!” Open Grafana on my phone — someone deployed the “smart recommendation cache” overnight and forgot to turn off INFO debug logs. 180k lines per second of “recommending product id=1488228 to user 8821.” No wonder everything died.
Write in the group chat: “Who merged at 02:44 without review?” Silence. Then the intern: “Oops, I thought if tests are green it's fine… it was only 180 lines.” The ticket, by the way, had been sitting in Code Review for three weeks.
By lunch the security guy shows up: “We have a leak. 2.7 million phone numbers and CVV codes are sitting in a public S3 bucket called company-name-backups-2025-public.” Yes, “public” right in the name. Created, of course, by the same intern because “not enough space locally.”
An hour later we get an email from HH.ru: “Congratulations, your company is in the Top 50 Most Attractive IT Employers according to employees!” Survey was conducted in October.
In the evening we're in the smoking area discussing relocation plans for 2026: Berlin (42% tax), Cyprus (boring), Yerevan (everyone's already there), or just move to Tver and remote for 450k RUB while the world burns. Decided to stay for now — at least here we know exactly where the fire is.
Just a regular Thursday. Tomorrow is Friday, which means someone will definitely deploy something epic right before the weekend so we all get to work overtime “for stability.” Tradition.
